# New Listing Research

## M7.1 public Spot symbol catalog

M7.1 loads one unauthenticated Binance `GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo` snapshot at startup and normalizes USDT-quoted symbols behind a provider-neutral contract. Each entry retains provider symbol, base and quote assets, status, and explicit Spot-trading availability. Results are sorted and retained in memory as the baseline for a future separately approved comparison.

Invalid USDT entries reject the snapshot; non-USDT entries are ignored. Loading uses a ten-second timeout, supports shutdown cancellation, and failure does not prevent application startup. This increment adds no polling, persistence, listing detection, HTTP route, scoring, signals, orders, or financial mutation.

## M7.2 durable symbol observations

Each successfully loaded catalog is transactionally upserted in PostgreSQL by provider and symbol. `firstObservedAt` is immutable after insertion, while `lastObservedAt`, status, assets, and Spot availability reflect the latest successful observation. These timestamps describe this application's observations and are not asserted to be Binance listing times. No polling, public route, alert, signal, or trading behavior is added.
