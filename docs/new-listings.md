# New Listing Research

## M7.1 public Spot symbol catalog

M7.1 loads one unauthenticated Binance `GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo` snapshot at startup and normalizes USDT-quoted symbols behind a provider-neutral contract. Each entry retains provider symbol, base and quote assets, status, and explicit Spot-trading availability. Results are sorted and retained in memory as the baseline for a future separately approved comparison.

Invalid USDT entries reject the snapshot; non-USDT entries are ignored. Loading uses a ten-second timeout, supports shutdown cancellation, and failure does not prevent application startup. This increment adds no polling, persistence, listing detection, HTTP route, scoring, signals, orders, or financial mutation.
